ABOUT
-----

This repository contains the code for the 3rd Party Display Kernel Device Driver
for the Android SGX driver. This is a kernel device driver for controlling the display
hardware. ‘Interfacing code’ is added to the driver allowing the display device
to be integrated with other Services managed devices.


BUILD
-----

A Makefile is provided to build this component.

First, export the following variables:

	$ export KERNELDIR=<path to kernel>
		e.g. /home/user/kernel

	$ export PVRKMDIR=<path to DDK repository>
		e.g. /home/user/img-ddk-linux-android

	$ export TARGET=<target product>
		e.g. omap5430

You can also specify the cross compiler to be used by exporting the variable

	$ export CROSS_COMPILE=<path to toolchain prefix>
		e.g. /home/user/cross_compiler/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

If CROSS_COMPILE is not specified, arm-none-linux-gnueabi- is used as default

To build, issue the make command

	$ make

If the build is successful, copy the generated kernel module files into your device in
the folder system/lib/modules/

To clean the generated binaries use the command

	$ make clean
